## A quiz react app

written and designed for my grandfathers 80th birthday

insert questions to questions.json file in this template:<br>
<code>
{<br>
"question": "question?",<br>
"rightAnswer": "Right answer",<br>
"wrongAnswers": ["three", "wrong", "answers"]<br>
}
</code>

the game will randomize their order and will only you continue when you click on the right answer
